**❤️TODO: I need to make a cron job which runs these two scripts on a cron every day.**

You can browse the vocab.html file via [https://sahilrajput03.github.io/vocab-files/vocab](https://sahilrajput03.github.io/vocab-files/vocab)

# Why?

Because loading a html version of vocab document is very time taking in browser via its google doc's published web version link.

Open this file dirctly in browser using this link: `file:///Users/apple/Documents/github_repos/vocab-web-server/vocab.html` (no need to start a web server to access this file, TESTED)
